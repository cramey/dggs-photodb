		<h3><a name="q1">What is the Geologic Photos of Alaska application?</a></h3>
		<p>
			Geologic Photos of Alaska is a web-based tool to discover photos taken
			during Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Survey (DGGS) field
			programs throughout the state of Alaska. The application contains a text
			and map-based search interface to make information easily accessible. The
			application provides information and a location for each photo, if known.
		</p>
		<p>
		 More information about the application and underlying data can be found in
		 the metadata file.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="q2">Can I use these photos?</a></h3>
		<p>
			All photos in Geologic Photos of Alaska are available for free public use
			courtesy of DGGS, unless otherwise credited. The application contains a
			minor number of photos credited to other data sources. See <a
			href="#q4">How should the photos be credited?</a>
		</p>
		<h3><a name="q3">How do I download a photo?</a></h3>
		<p>
			To save a full-resolution copy of a photo, click on a photo or its link
			below the photo to navigate to the detail (description) page for the
			photo. Right-click on the photo and select to save the image. A
			left-click on this image will open a full-resolution view of the photo.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="q4">How should the photos be credited?</a></h3>
		<p>
			Please cite the photographer and "Alaska Division of Geological &amp;
			Geophysical Surveys" when using an image. If a non-DGGS source is
			credited, you must obtain permission from the copyright holder and/or
			follow their citation specifications. An example DGGS citation: Photo
			courtesy of Rocky R. Reifenstuhl, Alaska Division of Geological &amp;
			Geophysical Surveys.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="q5">How do I search records in Geologic Photos of Alaska?</a></h3>
		<p>
			The Geologic Photos of Alaska application and underlying database may be
			queried by geographic area, specific text, or a combination of area and
			text. The buttons beneath the map control the numbers of photos that
			display at a time (6 through 96) and other results parameters.
		</p>
		<p>
			To search geographically an Area of Interest (AOI) tool is available from
			the map interface that queries the spatial footprints of the photos.
			Click on the AOI icon (gray button with black square) and click and drag
			your mouse to define your area of interest. The AOI search will run
			automatically. Clear your AOI search by clicking the AOI icon and
			selecting [Cancel]. You may repeat your exact search at a later time by
			saving the URL and re-entering it into the browser's address bar. Most
			photos have an associated spatial footprint, either as a discreet point
			when the location is well known or as an area when the location is not
			well known. Spatial footprints describing poorly known locations are not
			shown on the map, but are used for searching purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Search Bar above the map allows for queries of single and multiple
			terms, where multiple terms are always searched with an implied Boolean
			“AND.” Text from all photo description fields, except the date field, may
			be queried through the Search Bar. The photo file name, e.g.
			85DllnTlr.jpg, is also searchable, and is discoverable by hovering the
			mouse curser over an image.
		</p>
		<h4><a name="q6">How are the fields in the public interface defined?</a></h3>
		<p>
			Definitions of fields available in the public interface. See the metadata
			for a complete list of fields and definitions.
